# petpdfprint
Really simple doodad for someone on reddit (u/TalesFromTheBarkside - which is a solid username).
They need a simple way to print PDFs a bit more effectively. <br />
Download: https://github.com/mickeystix/petpdfprint/blob/34b50fa169cd7fce6feb53c1a37d0d7b4742d82d/dist/petprint.exe <br />
Click the ellipsis in the top-right and choose to download.

Here is how to use this:<br />
Step 1: Put all the potential files you might need to print into one folder. It doesn't matter where you put them, but I would say a folder on the Desktop is best.<br />
Step 2: Download the .exe that is in the dist folder here: https://github.com/mickeystix/petpdfprint/blob/main/dist/petprint.exe <br />
Step 3: Launch the .exe <br />
Step 4: Click the "Browse" button and choose the folder you created in Step 1.<br />
Step 5: It should list the items contained in the folder<br />
Step 6: Check the box next to whichever items you want to print. Next to the name it says the number of pages (if you are not seeing it, maybe rename your files)<br />
Step 7: If you need just specific pages, you can type the page/range into the text area next to the file name.<br />
Step 8: Click Print Selected PDFs - this will print to your DEFAULT printer.<br />
<br />
That's about it. Enjoy!
